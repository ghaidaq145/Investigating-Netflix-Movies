# Investigating-Netflix-Movies
Data analysis project exploring Netflix movie dataset using Python and Pandas.

## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores a dataset of Netflix movies and shows to uncover patterns related to release years, genres, and movie durations.  
It was developed as part of the **Associate Data Scientist in Python** career track on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com).

## 🧠 Objectives
- Practice Python and data analysis using Pandas.  
- Visualize and interpret trends in Netflix content.  
- Gain hands-on experience working with Jupyter Notebooks.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** — main programming language.  
- **Pandas** — data manipulation and cleaning.  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** — data visualization.  
- **Jupyter Notebook** — interactive analysis environment.

## 📈 Key Insights
- The number of Netflix releases increased significantly after 2010.  
- Movie durations have generally decreased over time.  
- Most recent Netflix titles are TV shows rather than movies.
